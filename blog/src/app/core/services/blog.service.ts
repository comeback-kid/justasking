This code is used by your audience to access the poll through the web (ie. justasking.io/uniquepollcode). Non-PREMIUM users get a randomly generated access code.</p><p>4 - Choose the theme of your poll from the <strong>Theme&nbsp;</strong>dropdown or leave the default theme on.</p><p>5 - You may ask multiple questions and provide multiple choices for each question by clicking on the <strong>Add Question</strong> and <strong>Add Answer</strong> buttons respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>6 - You may rearrange or remove these Questions and Answers by clicking on the menu button to the right of each Question and Answer and selecting the appropriate option.</p><p>7 - Click on <strong>Create poll&nbsp;</strong>and you will be taken to the <strong>Poll Details Screen</strong> of the poll where you can perform actions such as opening and closing the poll as well as sharing it with your audience.</p><p><br></p><h3>Managing your Votes Box Poll</h3><p>The following actions allow you to control and monitor your poll.</p><p><strong>Open poll</strong>: Allows participants to interact with the poll by the web, and if you&#39;re on <strong>PREMIUM</strong> by text messages as well.</p><p><strong>Close poll</strong>: Only visible while poll is Open. Closing the poll prevents further entries from being marked as responses for the poll. The poll is closed in real time, therefore anyone that is on the page to submit an entry will view a message informing them that the poll is now closed.</p><p><strong>Share poll</strong>: Allows you to copy the link of your poll or share it on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or LinkedIn).</p><p><strong>Go to poll</strong>: Takes you to the poll.</p><p><strong>Go to results</strong>: Takes you to the Poll Results Screen. You may view the responses come through in real time from both the Poll Details Screen or the Poll Results Screen.</p><p><strong>Activate/Deactivate Question</strong>: You may activate/deactivate a question for the poll by checking/unchecking the checkbox next to the Question. Deactivating a question will come in handy if you want to leverage SMS functionality for your poll; for this, you may only have 1 active question at a time.</p><p><br></p><h3 class="content-images-container">PREMIUM&nbsp;</h3><p>If you&#39;re currently on the PREMIUM plan, your poll will get a dedicated 10 digit phone number the moment you open the poll. Share this phone number with your audience to receive responses. Only one entry is allowed per participant.</p><p>SMS is only enabled if only one question is active in the votes box poll. You may deactivate/activate questions to allow you to receive SMS entries for multiple questions.</p><p>When you close a poll box which had an SMS associated with it, it will hold that phone number for up to 2 minutes for you. If you re-open the poll within 2 minutes, the same phone number will be associated with the poll; this avoids having to tell your audience to text another phone number for the poll.</p>`,

      Text: `<h3>What are word clouds?</h3><p>Word clouds are an easy way to gauge an audience&#39;s thoughts on an idea. Put simply, a word cloud is a collection of words on a screen. In more technical terms, a word cloud is a visual representation of a data set. Word clouds serve the same purpose as bar graphs, but convey information without axes or numbers. The relative size of a word in a word cloud gives an at-a-glance view of the word&#39;s frequency in the data set. Basically, the bigger the word in the word cloud, the more times it showed up in the data set.</p><div class="content-images-container"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justasking-blog.appspot.com/articles-images/wordcloud.png"></div><h3>When to use word clouds</h3><p>Word clouds are great for gathering an audience&#39;s opinion or general feeling about a topic. They work for ice breaker sessions, reflection on a past event, or gathering thoughts on a particular subject. For non-interactive sessions with no audience-submitted entries, word clouds are a quick way of displaying data where a bar graph might otherwise take too long to read and understand.</p><p></p><div class="content-images-container"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justasking-blog.appspot.com/articles-images/baseball_bargraph.png"> <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justasking-blog.appspot.com/articles-images/baseball.png"></div><p></p><p>Word Clouds work best when the audience is prompted to submit one-word entries. For example, if the audience is asked to &quot;Describe your experience with Company X&#39;s customer service in one word,&quot; responses might range from &quot;great,&quot; to &quot;terrible,&quot; to &quot;frustrating.&quot; In the end, what is left is a visual representation of how many people feel a certain way.</p><h3>How word clouds work at justasking.io</h3><p>If one audience member submits an entry for a word cloud, that entry will instantly become part of the word cloud. When a second audience member submits the same entry, the size of that word on the screen will increase. The size of an entry in a word cloud corresponds to the amount of times the audience has submitted it.</p><p>As a presenter, creating and managing word clouds at justasking.io is easy. From the New Poll Box screen, select &quot;Word Cloud&quot; from the dropdown menu, provide a header (normally the question you are asking your audience), and select a default word to appear in the center of your word cloud. The default word is optional. A preview screen to the right gives an idea of what the word cloud will look like once it&#39;s filled in with audience responses.</p><p></p><div class="content-images-container"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justasking-blog.appspot.com/articles-images/word_cloud_create.png"></div><p></p><p>Once the word cloud is created, you will be taken to the box details screen. This is where you will open your word cloud to entries from the audience, close it when the session is over, and administer the presentation&#39;s entries. The amount of users currently looking at the word cloud is displayed, as well as the total number of entries. These numbers are updated in real time as people visit the word cloud or submit entries.</p><p>Users can interact with the word cloud by either visiting its page in their browsers (at justasking.io/&lt;YourWordCloud&gt;,) or by text messaging the phone number provided to your box. Phone numbers are only provided to accounts on our PREMIUM plan. At the moment, there is no limit to the amount of entries an individual audience member can submit.</p><p>If a duplicate entry, accidental response, or unwanted word is added to the word cloud, it can be quickly removed by clicking on it in the box details page. Clicking on an entry will instantly hide or unhide it on the presentation page.</p><p></p><div class="content-images-container"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justasking-blog.appspot.com/articles-images/toggled.png"></div><p></p><h3>Word Clouds are awesome</h3><p>Word Clouds are a fun way to get an audience invested in a presentation. They give the room a sense of what everyone else thinks about a topic, and naturally opens up an avenue of dialogue between a presenter and audience. At justasking.io, we allow users on the BASIC plan to try out word clouds with no limit on the amount of entries, for free. <a href="https://justasking.io/getstarted/pricing">Click here</a> to get started.</p>`,

      Title: "5 Simple tricks to improve your presentations",
      SubTitle: "Improve your presentations today.",
      Text: `<p>&nbsp;Presenting to an audience can be a daunting experience. Thankfully, there are quick ways to get you setup to make it a breeze.&nbsp;</p><h2>1 - Don&#39;t memorize it word by word</h2><p>Here&#39;s the problem that I&#39;ve found when memorizing my presentations, I get nervous and I forget what to say. It takes half a second to derail your talk and lose your audience. When you&#39;re in front of an audience, big or small, weird things start to happen, your stomach clenches, you start to sweat, your voice cracks and you start to feel outside your element. If your presentation relies on you memorizing everything word by word, you&#39;re going to find yourself in a bit of trouble when you forget a word or a point you needed to make. Embrace this, and use it to your advantage, knowing that you could be nervous helps you prepare. Learn your main points, talk through them in multiple ways, so that if you happen to find yourself in a bad spot, you can quickly recover.&nbsp;</p><h2>2 - Record yourself</h2><p>I found it funny at first to record my presentations, but it helps you see yourself the way your audience will. Here&#39;s something that we&#39;re not always cognizant of, filler words. We all say them, a lot. It takes quite a bit of practice and self control to get them out of your presentations. Every time you say &quot;oh&quot;, &quot;hmm&quot;, or unnecessary &quot;so&quot;, &quot;then&quot;, just be aware, stop, and continue. Audiences appreciate silence between ideas, it helps them think and process what you&#39;re saying. Use this to your advantage to setup the next thing you&#39;re going to say. Mannerisms are very easy to be seen when you record yourself. Make sure that your body movements reflect your ideas and emphasize what you&#39;re trying to get across. Also, looking at yourself mess up lightens the mood while trying to prepare for your presentation.</p><h2>3 - Know your audience</h2><p>Sometimes we get so caught up on what we want to say that we forget that our audience might be familiar with the subject. Do a bit of research on whom you will be presenting to so that you can captivate your entire audience and not alienate those that already have an idea on the subject. Sometimes this is not feasible, for times like these, I recommend a quick impromptu poll to figure out what you can do without and what you can focus on instead. Audiences appreciate it when you tailor the presentation to them.</p><h2>4 - Respect the content/time ratio</h2><p>Ever sat through a quickly paced lecture with way too much content? Not particularly fun, no. Play with your content to match the allotted time you have. You want to make sure you keep audiences interested throughout the whole presentation, otherwise you&#39;ll lose them. Having too much content in too little time is a gamble when it comes to getting your message across. The information that we&#39;re presenting is familiar to us, so we understand it and we take liberties like talking too fast to make sure we have enough time for everything that we have to say. Even though it&#39;s not a conversation you have to give time for people to process what you&#39;re saying and this is very difficult if you dump a lot of information in a short period of time.</p><h2>5 - Learn from the experts</h2><p>There are plenty of examples out there of good presenters, people that do this for a living, people that have dedicated their lives to informing the world with their ideas. I recommend you check out some TED talks, here&#39;s one of my favorites : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to speak so that people want to listen | Julian Treasure</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Breathe in and out, take it slow, know yourself, your mannerisms, your ticks, and use them to your advantage on your presentations. Before you know it you&#39;ll start to see how your presentations improve.</p>`,

    Title: "Why we picked Angular",
    SubTitle: "We've had quite the journey since we first began to work on justasking.io during early May, 2017.",
    Text: `<h3>Why did we pick Angular as our front end framework?</h3><p>We&#39;ve had quite the journey since we first began to work on <a href="https://www.justasking.io">justasking.io</a> during early May, 2017. We set out to build an affordable real time polling solution and decided that using Angular for our front end was a good start. Angular 4 was freshly out of the oven and Angular Material was slowly but surely getting done as well. We wanted to build something with the latest technology and were willing to take risks, at the end of the day if it didn&#39;t work out, we could always switch to something else, like Vue or React.</p><p>I had some previous experiences with Angular 1 but I never felt too comfortable with its digest cycle, its controllers and factories. Angular 2 with Typescript, however, proved to be very different. It felt a lot more like .NET code, which if you&#39;ve worked with .NET MVC or .NET Web API, it&#39;ll feel familiar. Scaffolding the application felt more natural, and with the introduction of angular-cli it was a breeze to generate modules, components, services, and pretty much anything that Angular has to offer.</p><h3>We focused on what mattered to us.</h3><p>With our goal in mind to go fast and be able to provide as much value as possible in a short period of time, it felt like a no brainer. Angular and its cli tool helped us quickly get up to speed with a prototype. It allowed us to have a proof of concept within a couple of weeks and make a decision on whether or not we wanted to move forward with Angular for the front end. Progressing out of the POC and into the actual web application was not an easy task, we wanted to leverage features like lazy loading modules, progressive enhancements and unit testing.</p><p>When you have features you want to build, the last thing you want to worry about is the plumbing. For example, routing in an application should be intuitive and easy to implement. Given how heavily we rely on routes and templates, we were very pleased with how easy Angular lets you setup routing at a modular level so you can lazy load the module along with all of its routes. Your users will only download the resources needed at the time. This makes the initial load time significantly faster. Spending less time setting up and more time adding features is a big benefit that we have found with Angular.</p><h3>It&#39;s not for everybody.</h3><p>We&#39;re not oblivious to the negative aspects of Angular, and I don&#39;t want to mislead you. Angular is not light, in our case, the majority of the app&#39;s JavaScript size goes to Angular and not our code. Angular is versatile, which is a double edged sword, it takes a while to get the hang of it and even longer to master ... will let you know when I get there, don&#39;t hold your breath. It&#39;s got a steep learning curve. We&#39;re willing to take these risks and respect the downsides of the framework because of the many benefits that line up with our development process.</p><p>So far, it works for us and our code base has scaled quite nicely.</p> `
